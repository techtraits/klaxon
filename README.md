klaxon
======
klaxon is an alerting dashboard for [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) written in [Go](|http://golang.org) and designed to run on [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/). Klaxon is modeled after the [Seyren](https://github.com/scobal/seyren) frame work but provides multitenancy as well as authentication.

## Status
We are currently in development, we have skeleton servlet handlers setup as well as our data objects and we hope to rest only implementation done fairly soon. Following which we will concentrate on the user interface. 

The tip of this code base is deployed to https://go-klaxon.go-klaxon.appspot.com/
